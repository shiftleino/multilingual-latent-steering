mentioned in the categories. Do NOT evaluate the correctness or the coherence of the response. Begin your evaluation by assessing whether the response fits to each of the two categories and provide a short explanation. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, 
output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "[[1]]" if category 1 matches better, and "[[2]]" if category 2 matches 
better.
